!!! info "About"
    This year's challenge focuses on online news recommendation, addressing both the technical and normative challenges inherent in designing effective and responsible recommender systems for news publishing. The challenge will delve into the unique aspects of news recommendation, including modeling user preferences based on implicit behavior, accounting for the influence of the news agenda on user interests, and managing the rapid decay of news items. Furthermore, our challenge embraces the normative complexities, involving investigating the effects of recommender systems on the news flow and whether they resonate with editorial values.

!!! info "Challenge Task"
    The Ekstra Bladet RecSys Challenge aims to predict which article a user will click on from a list of articles that were seen during a specific impression. Utilizing the user's click history, session details (like time and device used), and personal metadata (including gender and age), along with a list of candidate news articles listed in an impression log, the challenge's objective is to rank the candidate articles based on the user's personal preferences. This involves developing models that encapsulate both the users and the articles through their content and the users' interests. The models are to estimate the likelihood of a user clicking on each article by evaluating the compatibility between the article's content and the user's preferences. The articles are ranked based on these likelihood scores, and the precision of these rankings is measured against the actual selections made by users. [[1]](https://recsys.eb.dk/)

!!! info note "Dataset Information"
    The Ekstra Bladet News Recommendation Dataset (EB-NeRD) was created to support advancements in news recommendation research. It was collected from user behavior logs at Ekstra Bladet. We collected behavior logs from active users during the 6 weeks from April 27 to June 8, 2023. This timeframe was selected to avoid major events, e.g., holidays or elections, that could trigger atypical behavior at Ekstra Bladet. The active users were defined as users who had at least 5 and at most 1,000 news click records in a three-week period from May 18 to June 8, 2023. To protect user privacy, every user was delinked from the production system when securely hashed into an anonymized ID using one-time salt mapping. Alongside, we provide Danish news articles published by Ekstra Bladet. Each article is enriched with textual context features such as title, abstract, body, categories, among others. Furthermore, we provide features that have been generated by proprietary models, including topics, named entity recognition (NER), and article embeddings. [[2]](https://recsys.eb.dk/dataset/)

## News Recommendation

!!! question "Why do we care about news recommendations?" 

With the rise of online news services like Google News, millions now access news conveniently online. However, finding relevant articles can be challenging. Personalized news recommender systems (NRS) address this by tailoring recommendations to individual interests, enhancing user experience and saving time. These systems track recent user interactions and incorporate factors like publication date, recency, and popularity into their algorithms.

!!! question "What are important aspects of personalized news recommenders?"
Unlike recommendation methods based solely on non-personalized factors like news popularity and freshness, personalized news recommendation (PNR) deeply considers each user's interests. It matches news content, location, and category to user preferences, offering personalized services. Key characteristics of PNR include:

1) **Diversity**: High-quality recommendations require diverse results to enhance user experience and engagement. Most methods focus on accuracy, often neglecting diversity.

2) **Timeliness**: Delivering news quickly is crucial, as the value of news diminishes over time.

3) **Popularity**: Current methods predict click-through rates (CTR) using headlines, summaries, and entities, but few integrate news popularity and user attention to popular news in their predictions.


!!! question "How can we solve this problem?"

Understanding how predictions are made by standard news recommenders is often difficult due to unclear influencing factors. To address this, identifying the key factors that determine whether a user will click on an article is crucial. This approach offers several benefits:

1) It helps system designers understand user behavior and improve recommendations.

2) Transparent recommendations can increase user trust and acceptance.

3) An explainable system enhances user experience, building overall trust.

!!! question "What are area in which personalzied news recommendations fall under?"

### Time-Based News Recommendation
Time-based news recommendation involves timeliness and real-time updates, crucial features that distinguish news recommendations from others. News loses value over time, so systems must update recommendations based on current user behavior (e.g., pulling and sliding). This ensures quick adaptation to changing interests and enhances the user experience.

Liu et al. propose a dual-task deep neural network model that uses an extended time module to refine news embedding and predict user engagement time. This method improves the timeliness of recommendations and promotes the dissemination of the latest news. However, it can slightly diminish the focus on user interests, highlighting the need to balance timeliness and user preferences in news recommendation systems.

### Location-Based News Recommendation
Mobile users' locations vary, making it essential to consider their current location for more accurate news recommendations. Location-based news recommendations help users find local news and stay updated on nearby events. However, research often focuses on improving location matching accuracy, neglecting location-aware user preferences.

Yuan et al. address this by incorporating the location of news events into recommendation models. They propose an algorithm to extract news event locations and use a vector space model to represent news features. Separate user interest models are then constructed for news with and without geographical locations. [[2]](https://www.jsjkx.com/EN/Y2018/V45/I11A/462)

### Social Network-Based News Recommendation
Social networks, composed of nodes (individuals) and edges (relationships), enable users to make friends and share information, significantly impacting information dissemination. Social information, reflecting users' and their friends' activities, captures the dynamic and diverse nature of user interests. Experiments show that incorporating social factors dynamically captures changing user interests, improving news recommendation effectiveness. 

Saravanapriya et al. propose a multilabel convolutional neural network that mines social media to predict users' multilabel interests and recommend popular news articles based on user tags.

### Sesssion-Based News recommendation
Session-based news recommendation models user preferences over short periods to provide personalized reading suggestions.

Moreira et al. propose Chameleon, a session-based deep learning meta-architecture using recurrent neural networks (RNN) to model users' sequential interests. [[4]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.10367)

!!! question "How do traditional recommendaton system methods apply to news?"
Traditional news recommendation methods fall into three categories: collaborative filtering-based, content-based, and hybrid methods.

1) **Collaborative filtering**: Recommends news based on user similarities or news similarity. However, it often faces data sparsity and cold start issues due to insufficient user ratings, metadata, and textual content for new or less popular news.

2) **Content-based**: Recommends news with similar content to the clicked news, focusing on mining semantic features of news texts.

3) **Hybrid**: Combines collaborative filtering and content-based approaches to overcome limitations of individual methods.

!!! question "Personalized News Recommender Workflow"
In a personalized news recommender system, when a user visits the platform, a small set of candidate news is recalled from a large pool. The personalized recommender then ranks these based on inferred user interests from profiles. The top K news are displayed, and user behaviors on these are recorded to update user profiles for future recommendations. [[5]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.08934)

There are three key components in this architecture that are crucial in providing accurate recommendations:

1) News Modeling

News modeling, crucial for news recommendation, employs two main techniques: feature-based and deep learning-based methods.

**Feature-based**: Relies on handcrafted features to represent news articles. For example, in collaborative filtering (CF), news articles are often represented by their IDs. However, this approach suffers from severe cold-start problems and suboptimal performance.

**Deep learning-based**: Incorporates content features to represent news, often using features extracted from news texts. For instance, methods like SF-IDF use WordNet synonym sets to enhance TF-IDF. Additionally, factors like news popularity and recency are considered. However, manually designing features requires significant effort and domain knowledge, and may not fully capture semantic information encoded in news texts.

2) User Modeling

User modeling techniques in news recommendation fall into two main categories: feature-based and deep learning-based methods.

**Feature-based**: Often represent users with their IDs but suffer from data sparsity issues. To improve accuracy, other user information such as click behaviors on news is considered. For instance, Garcin et al. use Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to extract topics from news titles, summaries, and bodies, aggregating topic vectors of clicked news into a user vector.

**Deep learning-based**: Utilize deep learning techniques to model user interests more accurately. These methods can automatically learn complex patterns from user interactions with news articles, potentially alleviating the need for manual feature engineering.

3) Personalized Ranking

Once news and user interests are modeled, the next step is to rank candidate news in a personalized manner. Methods typically prioritize news based on their relevance to user interests. Accurately measuring this relevance is the core challenge in personalized news ranking.


!!! question "How do we evaluate these methods?"

Various metrics evaluate news recommender system performance, focusing on ranking relevance. The Area Under Curve (AUC) score is commonly used, especially in methods treating recommendation as a classification problem.

$$ AUC = \frac{|\left((i,j)|Rank(p_i) < Rank(n_j)\right)|}{N_pN_n}$$

$N_p$ and $N_n$ represent the numbers of positive and negative samples, respectively. $p_i$ is the predicted score of the $i$-th positive sample, and $n_j$ is the score of the $j$-th negative sample.

Due to the large volume of news, users typically focus more on news at the top of the recommendation list. Some methods adjust recommendation results based on the ranking list. Common ranking evaluation metrics include MRR (mean reciprocal rank) and NDCG (normalized discounted cumulative gain).

$$MRR = \frac{1}{|U|}\sum_{u \in U}\frac{1}{rank_a}$$

Here, $u \in U$ traverses all users, and $rank_u$ denotes the position of the first TP example in the user recommendation list.

$$ NDCG@K = \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^k (2^{r_i} - 1)/log_2(l+i)}{\sum_{u \in U} 1/log_2(l+i)}$$ 

where $r_i$ is the relevance score of the $i$-th news. If user clicks on the $i$-th news, the value of $r_i$ is 1.
